# Laser-De-La-Justice

Integrative Group Project that consists of a "Bubble trouble" inspired game in Java , where the user try to shoot bubbles that split into several smaller ones without them landing on their head. To make this application more scientific, we added physics by implementing gravity, reflection and refraction, 2D collision between shapes and much more!
